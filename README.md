# Travel-Planner (Triptation)

* As a tourist on vacation, I want to be able to find popular nearby attractions and local weather, so that I can create an itinerary for my vacation. 

## Description

* A web application was built so that a user may enter their desired city and recieve suggestions for popular spots around that area with a picture and description. They may also enter the dates for when they are visiting the city, so that they may view the current weather during those dates including: weather conditions, tempurature, wind speeds, UV index, and humidity. At the bottom of the web application they may write down the activities they wish to partake in and add it to their itinerary which saves in local storage. They may then access this itinerary on a seperate page which include the date and city of the task they placed. 

## Technologies used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bulma.io
* Visual Crossing: Weather Data & Weather API
* OpenTripMap API
